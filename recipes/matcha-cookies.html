    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Combine powdered sugar, butter, and brown sugar in the bowl of a 
            stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat on medium speed, 
            then increase speed and continue to mix until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Mix in 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour, matcha, baking soda, 
            baking powder, and salt until combined.</li>    
        <li>Mix in egg and vanilla, gradually lowering the speed setting until 
            everything is evenly incorporated and you get a dough-like texture.</li>
        <li>Add white chocolate chips and mix in evenly.</li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool on the baking sheet briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool, 
            5 to 10 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
